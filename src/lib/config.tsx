          "Crypto-native users whose financial life already lives onchain: traders, freelancers paid in USDC, founders. They want to run their money from their phone and stay private by default, without giving up the cards and bank transfers they still rely on every day.",

        answer:
          "Only for the banking side: cards, virtual account, bank transfers. The private wallet stays permissionless, and you can use it without ever passing KYC. We apply KYC where the law demands it, not across the whole product.",

          "Yes. Arcium brings protocol-level confidentiality to Solana without giving up the liquidity and DeFi depth that make the chain worth using. Zcash and Monero solved privacy years ago, but neither has that ecosystem around it, so you'd be trading one problem for another.",
